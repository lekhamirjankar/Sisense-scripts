# Sisense-scripts
Sisense widget and dashboard scripts that enhance the built-in capabilities of the BI tool.

When I started working on this tool, there weren't enough resources for scripting or otherwise (still aren't :P); and it took some trial and error to get things working. In this repo, I've compiled all the scripts that I've used while working on Sisense; hoping they will help you. Things keep changing in Sisense so these scripts may/may not work for your version of the product. You can use these as a first step and customize for your needs. If anythimg can be optimized/done better, do let me know.
